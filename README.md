# Project decription
"Brain Games" is a set of five simple console games. Each game asks a maximum of three questions and to succeed you need to answer all of them correctly. If not you'll lose but don't get frustrated - sometimes we all get unlucky.

## "Brain Games" offers following games:

Brain even: Challenge you to define if a given number even or not.
Brain prime: Challenge you to define if a given number prime or not.
Brain gcd: Challenge you to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
Brain calculator: Challenge you to calculate random mathemathic expressions.
Brain progression: Challenge you to find missing numbers in a progression row.
